    "To simulate the wine production process outlined in the project proposal using Discrete Event Simulation (DES), we follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Setup**:\n",
    "   - Define simulation entities: grape varietals, production inputs, warehouses, distribution networks, and local shops.\n",
    "   - Initialize system state: inventory levels, warehouse capacities, and production schedules.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Event Creation**:\n",
    "   - **Grape Harvest**: Triggered by the seasonal availability of different grape varietals.\n",
    "   - **Production Start**: Initiated when enough grapes and inputs are available. It simulates fermentation, aging, and bottling processes, each with specific time delays and resource consumption.\n",
    "   - **Inventory Movement**: Represents the transfer of goods between production facility, winery's warehouse, bonded warehouse, and local warehouse, influenced by production output and storage capacities.\n",
    "   - **Market Sale**: Occurs when wine reaches local shops, influenced by market demand and pricing strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Event Processing**:\n",
    "   - Sequentially process events based on the simulation clock. Each event updates the system's state: production capacity utilization, inventory levels, and warehouse space usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Randomness and Variability**:\n",
    "   - Introduce randomness in grape yield, production delays, and market demand to reflect real-world uncertainties.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Collection and Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Throughout the simulation, collect data on key performance metrics: profit maximization, utilization rates, and supply chain efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Scenario Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Run simulations under various scenarios (e.g., capacity expansion, market expansion, cost reduction) to identify the most efficient strategies for profit maximization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation will allow for the detailed analysis and optimization of the wine production and distribution system, enabling the identification of bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and opportunities for improvement across the entire supply chain."
